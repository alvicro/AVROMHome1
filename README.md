# AVROMHome1
A new repository with home tasks from 12.04.23.
In this repository I would like to put some files from my temporal repository GITNEW.
All these files would be connected with such home tasks:
a) GITNEW consists of a new project html/css - this is the main project which is named as MixedHomeTasksHTMLCSS (MHT-HTMLCSS);
b) From the main page of MHT-HTMLCSS we have a reference to a Table;
c) From the main page of MHT-HTMLCSS we have a reference to a List;
d) From the main page of MHT-HTMLCSS we have a reference to the Pictures;
e) From the main page of MHT-HTMLCSS we have a reference to an Adaptive Design;
